#### Restaurant options {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

##### Boca Grande

With a stunning design signed by the trendiest designer Lazaro Rosa-Viola, the space welcomes us with an attractive decorative eclecticism that is both original and striking. The sober and elegant New York style decor is indeed the main attraction of each and every single space in Boca Grande.
The restaurant, the kitchen of which is led by Xavier Tranque (The Mirror, Ovic) and based on seafood to offer a quality menu, is on the ground floor and dominated by bar where oysters, lobsters, prawns... are displayed. It also has a great terrace in the patio of the building.

The second floor is a fabulous cocktail bar with an oriental touch that will definitely witness great nights, while the top floor houses a nice private room with terrace. Interestingly enough, the bathrooms are located in the basement and share the space with the resident DJ's booth and dim lighting that creates the perfect atmosphere for intimate encounters.

### **DAY 3: Sunday, May 12th** 

Guests will return to the Circuit de Catalunya to enjoy the F1 Race, they will depart from the hotel at 9.00h and they will return at 16.00h, so, they will be at the hotel at 17.00h (approximately)

After some free time to refresh and relax, at 20.00h they will go by bus to the restaurant to have dinner.
For the last night we suggest a restaurant located near the sea. The first option: Torre d'Alta Mar is located in a tower and it offers stunnig 360 views. The second option: Pez Vela is a very good restaurant specialized in rice dishes, located at the beach with great city views.

#### Restaurant options {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

##### Torre d'Alta Mar

Located on one of the towers of the cable car that goes from La Barceloneta to Montjuic, 75 meters high, Torre d'Alta Mar presents an idyllic scenerio for the most special evenings.

With an exquisite contemporary interior design, the luxurious restaurant served up its best dish in the shape of spectacular views over the Mediterranean sea and the city of Barcelona. The experience begins in a glass lift that won't let us miss any details of the privileged place where are in. Once in the restaurant, the setting is simply astonishing, especially at night, and more than well worth a visit to the restaurant.

The menu offers the best of the Mediterraean gastronomy, with top quality products and the chef's personal touch.

<img src = "http://thebestindesign.net/images/articles/00264-torre-dalta-mar/torre_daltamar_full.jpg"> 


##### Pez Vela

The style and design define the environment in which this new referent welcomes us in the area, an exquisite space designed by Sandra Tarruella. In a fresh, modern and informal atmosphere, beach and Mediterranean elements combine with industrial aesthetics, plenty of natural light and unique views. The terrace is simply a luxury, ideal also for a summer drink after dinner.

The menu of Pez Vela is centered on salads and rice dishes, but also includes a good selection of wild fish and charcoal grilled meats. The dishes are made with fresh products of the highest quality that retain all the natural flavor.

<img src = "http://imag.bonviveur.es/articulos/exterior-del-restaurante-pez-vela.jpg"> 

### **DAY 4: Monday, May 13th** 

Guests will enjoy a free morning to go for a walk or do some shopping.

At 12.00h guests will meet at El Nacional for eating some tapas before their departure.
**El National** is a new culinary concept: an emblematic restaurant with different spaces to enjoy traditional dishes of the peninsula made with excellent ingredients.

We suggest La Taperia, where they will enjoy a modern tapas menu based on the most traditional dishes elaborated with fresh, seasonal products.

Restaurant built in a modernist space dating from 1889, with Catalan ceilings and skylights that give way to the light illuminating the huge room. Interior designed by Lazaro Rosa-Violan, inspired by the 30s and 40. With four specialized bars. With a singular charm, it is an extraordinary architectural work.
